# Lessenger API Implementation

This is my solution to the [Hipmunk Lessenger problem](https://github.com/Hipmunk/hipproblems/tree/master/lessenger).

# How to use
First, clone the repository into a directory of your choice.

>`git clone git@github.com:yzxchn/lessenger_api.git`

Change into the project root, and put the separately provided `keys.config` file here.

Then, install the dependencies.

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the server with the following command:

  `python3 manage.py runserver 9000`
